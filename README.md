This notebook contains the source code for the publication titled ["A Computational Model for the ICAP Framework: Exploring Agent-Based Modeling as an AIED Methodology"](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-36272-9_73) by Rismanchian, S., and Doroudi, S., presented at the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education in July 2023 (pp. 792-797).

The code is being released as open source to facilitate the investigations of researchers and practitioners interested in exploring a concrete example of an agent-based model based on the teaching and learning theoretical framework known as ICAP (Chi, M.T., Wylie, R.: The ICAP framework: Linking cognitive engagement to active learning outcomes. Educational Psychologist 49(4), 219â€“243 (2014)). You are encouraged to clone the code and modify different implementations and scenarios to examine their effects on the model's outcomes. Feel free to contribute and experiment to further enhance our understanding of the ICAP framework and its applications.

Any questions? Please feel free to reach out to me at srismanc@uci.edu.
